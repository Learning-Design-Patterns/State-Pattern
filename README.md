# State Pattern
  * State pattern allows a object differnetly when it state changes at run time.
  * For an example 
    * Think of UI control which has Draw abstract method.
    * There is a Textbox control which implements the UI control's Draw method.
    * Also there is Checkbox control which implements the UI control's Draw method.
    * So when we create a object refernce with Textbox control the object will behave differnetly than when we create with reference of Checkbox control
